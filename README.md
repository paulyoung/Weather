## Inspiration
I saw that my friend Dan at [Permalight](http://permalightnyc.com/) had taken a skillshare class on iOS app design.

After looking over [Dan’s project](http://www.skillshare.com/Design-Beautiful-Apps-iOS-App-Design-UX/771498797/1526239362/projects/9246/) I decided to see if I could make it a reality by the end of the day, and this is the result.

## Features
* Use of CoreLocation to obtain the user’s location before requesting forecast data.
* Conversion of touch gestures to hours of the day for scrubbing forwards and backwards through time.
* Use of a quadratic equation to convert time into opacity in order to update the background color based on the position of the sun.
